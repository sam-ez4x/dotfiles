FONTS
=====
Making sure the same fonts are available on all systems is annoying, 
especially when you are used to a specific font and have it embedded
in some of your environment's configuration.  For this reason, I am 
adding some of the fonts in here, just so that I don't have find them
all over again when I move to another system.
